# Club Dashboard

> Consolidated from `CLUB_PAGE_CHANGES.md`. Updated to reflect the refactored
> component structure.

## Overview

The club dashboard at `/club` is built from focused sub-components under
`components/club/` and composes three tabs:

| Tab                    | Value         | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| IIC Activities         | `iic`         | IIC-hosted events assigned to this club       |
| Self Driven Activities | `self-hosted` | Events created by the club itself             |
| My Calendar Activities | `calendar`    | IIC events the club has added to its calendar |

## IIC Activities Tab

- Shows only `status: "approved"` IIC events assigned to this club.
- **Filters**: semester/quarter dropdown, free-text search.
- Each card has **View Details** and **Add to Calendar** / **Remove from Calendar**.

## Self Driven Activities Tab

Two nested tabs: **Current** (end date ≥ today) and **Past** (end date < today).

- **Current** includes an **Add New Event** card that opens `CreateEventDialog`.
- The dialog submits via `POST /api/events/create` (authenticated + club-owned).

## My Calendar Activities Tab

A full-width table (`calendar-table.tsx`) with columns:

| Column                 | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| S.No.                  | Row index                                                          |
| Title of Activity      | Name, semester/quarter, free/paid badge                            |
| View Activity Details  | Opens `IICEventDetailDialog`                                       |
| Upload Activity Report | Routes to `/club/event/[id]#after-event`                           |
| Report Status          | Badge: Not Started / Report Submitted / Media Uploaded / Completed |
| Reviewer's Comment     | Text or "NA"                                                       |
| Review for Request     | Text or "NA"                                                       |
| Download Report        | Disabled (not yet implemented)                                     |
| Action                 | Delete row from calendar                                           |

### Report status logic (`utils.ts → getReportStatus`)

| Condition                           | Label            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| No `after_event_report` row         | Not Started      |
| `report_submitted = true`           | Report Submitted |
| `report_submitted + media_uploaded` | Media Uploaded   |
| All three flags true                | Completed        |
